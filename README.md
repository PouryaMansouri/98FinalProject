# 🌟 Enhanced RSS Feed Aggregator: The Quest for the Ultimate Django Backend Project 🚀🐳🌈

Greetings, seasoned Django developers! Your journey towards creating the ultimate Django backend project for aggregating and managing RSS feeds has just leveled up. With your skills and determination as your guiding stars 🌟, you are destined to excel in this grand endeavor.

## 🚀 The Mission

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to craft a cutting-edge web application that serves as a central hub for collecting, analyzing, and managing RSS feeds from diverse sources. In this digital odyssey, you will empower users to subscribe to their preferred feeds, explore the world of information, and interact with content in new and innovative ways. The Project Coordinator, Pourya Mansouri, has summoned you to embark on this quest, with the unwavering support of your mentors 🚀.

## 📆 The Blueprint

The journey to triumph is divided into four distinct sections, each brimming with 100 points of potential. The inaugural section spans two weeks, while the subsequent sections each require one week of dedicated effort.

- Map the data structure of each RSS feed source to the appropriate database model fields, considering dynamic content.

#### Advanced Data Model Design 📊 (30 points)

- Create advanced models for RSS feeds, feed items, user subscriptions, and user interactions.
- Implement advanced data validation and constraints.
- Design a flexible schema that can accommodate diverse feed structures.

#### Project Setup and Analysis Documentation (10 points)

- Create a comprehensive project setup guide.
- Document your advanced analysis and data mapping approaches.
- Discuss strategies for handling evolving feed structures.

### Section 2: Advanced RSS Feed Scraping, Content Processing, and Dockerization (100 points)

#### Advanced RSS Feed Scraping 📰 (30 points)

- Implement a distributed feed scraping system with Celery, allowing for parallel processing of multiple feeds.
- Handle edge cases, such as rate limiting, feed updates, and failed scrapes.
- Create a retry mechanism for failed scrapes.

#### Content Enrichment and Processing 🌐 (40 points)

- Extract and analyze content from feed items, including text, images, and embedded media.
- Implement custom algorithms for categorizing and summarizing feed content.
- Create custom algorithms for sentiment analysis and content recommendations.
- Allow users to interact with enriched content, such as liking, commenting, and saving.

#### Dockerization 🐳 (30 points)

- Dockerize your Django application for development.
- Create a `Dockerfile` that sets up the necessary environment for your Django project, including Python dependencies and database connections.
- Use Docker Compose to define a development environment with services like PostgreSQL for the database and Celery for distributed task processing.
- Configure Docker Compose to link your Django application with these services.

### Section 3: Periodic Updates, Logging, and Event Tracking (100 points)

#### Periodic Feed Updates 🚀 (30 points)
- Implement periodic tasks using a task scheduler (e.g., Celery Beat) to update RSS feeds at defined intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
- Configure the task scheduler to trigger feed updates automatically.
- Handle edge cases, such as rate limiting and concurrent feed updates, to ensure data integrity.
- Store all update events and errors in an Elasticsearch database for monitoring and analysis.

#### Logging and Event Tracking (40 points)
- Store every API request and response in one log.
- Store Celery task actions and status changes in a dedicated log.
- Follow best practices for structuring logs to facilitate troubleshooting and analysis.

#### RabbitMQ Integration (30 points)
- Replace Advanced User Notifications with a RabbitMQ-based system for publishing and consuming events.
- Publish all login or register events and token refresh actions to RabbitMQ.
- Implement event consumers to perform user-related actions based on published events.

## Section 4: Final Enhancements and Multilingual Support (100 points)

#### Complete Last Sections (50 points)
- Finish implementing the remaining tasks from the previous sections.
- Ensure all functionalities are working correctly and have been thoroughly tested.

#### Add Django Translate for Multilingual Support (50 points)
