### Section 2: Advanced RSS Feed Scraping, Content Processing, and Dockerization (100 points)

#### Advanced RSS Feed Scraping 📰 (30 points)

- Implement a distributed feed scraping system with Celery, allowing for parallel processing of multiple feeds.
- Handle edge cases, such as rate limiting, feed updates, and failed scrapes.
- Create a retry mechanism for failed scrapes.

#### Content Enrichment and Processing 🌐 (40 points)

- Extract and analyze content from feed items, including text, images, and embedded media.
- Implement custom algorithms for categorizing and summarizing feed content.
- Create custom algorithms for sentiment analysis and content recommendations.
- Allow users to interact with enriched content, such as liking, commenting, and saving.

#### Dockerization 🐳 (30 points)

- Dockerize your Django application for development.
- Create a `Dockerfile` that sets up the necessary environment for your Django project, including Python dependencies and database connections.
- Use Docker Compose to define a development environment with services like PostgreSQL for the database and Celery for distributed task processing.
- Configure Docker Compose to link your Django application with these services.

### Section 3: Periodic Updates, Logging, and Event Tracking (100 points)

#### Periodic Feed Updates 🚀 (30 points)
- Implement periodic tasks using a task scheduler (e.g., Celery Beat) to update RSS feeds at defined intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
- Configure the task scheduler to trigger feed updates automatically.
- Handle edge cases, such as rate limiting and concurrent feed updates, to ensure data integrity.
- Store all update events and errors in an Elasticsearch database for monitoring and analysis.

#### Logging and Event Tracking (40 points)
- Store every API request and response in one log.
- Store Celery task actions and status changes in a dedicated log.
- Follow best practices for structuring logs to facilitate troubleshooting and analysis.

#### RabbitMQ Integration (30 points)
- Replace Advanced User Notifications with a RabbitMQ-based system for publishing and consuming events.
- Publish all login or register events and token refresh actions to RabbitMQ.
- Implement event consumers to perform user-related actions based on published events.


### Section 4: Advanced Logging with Structlog and Elasticsearch, Final Enhancements (100 points)

#### Logging with Structlog and Elasticsearch 📈 (50 points)

- Incorporate Structlog for structured logging within your Django application.
- Configure Structlog to format logs in a structured JSON format.
- Implement logging for critical application events, such as feed scraping errors, user interactions, and system health checks.
- Integrate Elasticsearch as a log storage backend for efficient log management.
- Set up Elasticsearch indices and templates for log storage.
- Create a searchable log repository using Elasticsearch to monitor and debug application events.
- Implement log rotation and retention policies for managing log data.
